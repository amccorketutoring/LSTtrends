# UHI Vulnerability Index Module

This module computes an Urban Heat Vulnerability Index for Knox County using a combination of geospatial and environmental indicators. The index integrates land surface temperature (LST), building density, vegetation (NDVI), and slope to identify heat-vulnerable areas.

## Features

- Loads preprocessed CSV of zonal statistics including coordinates and indicators.
- Converts the dataset into a GeoDataFrame using latitude/longitude.
- Normalizes contributing features using `MinMaxScaler`.
- Inverts NDVI and Slope so that high vegetation and steep slopes reduce vulnerability.
- Computes a composite vulnerability index as the mean of the normalized scores.
- Generates a plot of the vulnerability index using `matplotlib` and `geopandas`.

## Functions

This script is currently run as a standalone module. It does not contain reusable functions but performs the following steps:

1. **Data loading**
2. **Coordinate conversion to geometry**
3. **Feature inversion for NDVI and slope**
4. **Min-max normalization of selected variables**
5. **Composite index calculation**
6. **Map rendering and display**

## Inputs

- `Knox_UHI_Zonal_Stats_STRM.csv`: A CSV file with the following columns:
    - `longitude`
    - `latitude`
    - `LST_Celsius`
    - `NDVI`
    - `BuildingDensity`
    - `Slope`

## Output

- `UHI_Vulnerability_Map.png` (or displayed inline if run interactively)
- A GeoDataFrame with an added `VulnerabilityIndex` column

## Example

```python
from lsttrends.analysis import UHI_Vulnerability_Index_Knox
